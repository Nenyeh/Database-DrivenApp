This week, I fell behind on schoolwork and homework because I was ill and hospitalized. As a result I could not do much of the homework for the week. However, I was able to do some and learn from it and this was for the database.
To create a database, I first had to follow the instructions on moodle which was to download mobaxterm which is a toolbox for remote computing. Then I logged in to the VPN network which I had already gotten permission for. The next step was to ssh in mobaxterm with my username and password.
I tried to do this, but it kept telling me permission denied. I contacted Dr Jones to understand why this was happening then I realized that I was using the wrong password. I was supposed to use my Berea username as password but I was using my Berea password. Unfortunately however even though I used the correct username, I still was unable to login. I tried up to 9 times, I opened a different window on mobaxterm, I closed the current window I was using and it still did not work. I was getting frustrated until I decided to change up a few things. Instead of using “Chukwuemekan” as I had been doing, I used “chukwuemekan” changing the caps lock. This was where the problem was. I realized that even though database systems were not case sensitive, logging in and inputting my username and password was. 
After I was finally able to login, I went on to download the database system I was going to use (postgresql). I chose this because I had a little knowledge of it from my previous internship. I also went ahead to create roles in this database system, and then went on to create the database where that I would be using.
Although I did not do as much as I wanted this week, I learned few things about database systems, and got better in remote computing
