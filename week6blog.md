# Database-DrivenApp
This week, I have learned that when inputting one after the other into the database, it is much harder than when you have a code like COPY persons(first_name, last_name, dob, email)FROM 'C:\sampledb\persons.csv'DELIMITER ','CSV HEADER;
For the code above to work in my database, I would have to change a few things. I would change the ‘persons’ to the table name I want which would be ‘science_org.’ Next, I would change the first_name,’last_name’, ‘dob’, ‘email’ to the columns in my table. If the columns were 4, I would replace it with the four columns. If they were three, I would take out one of the columns and so on.
I tried this, and got an error. I informed my professor who advised me to remove certain characters in the column I wanted to copy from the spreadsheet. I adhered to this and tried again and received another error. I went on the internet to try and fix this error but it would not work as expected. After about three days of trying to fix a lot of errors, I finally informed my professor who said I could input the rows in one by one. This was very tasking because there were about 350 lines of code and about 20 columns. This meant to input each of them one after the other. To do this, it was essential that I had to copy and paste the texts, to avoid mistakes and also to be faster. But I did not know how to copy and paste yet in postgreSQL. I informed my professor about this, and she told me to check first if I could copy and paste in MobaXterm. As this was what I was using for the Database. I realized that she was right and searched on google how to do this. Now for moba xterm, you would highlight the words or phrases you wanted to copy but you do not have to ‘control C’ it to copy. The highlighting was enough. To paste it, you do not have to ‘control V’ also. All you had to do was to click your mouse on where you wanted to paste and the text you had highlighted earlier on would paste there. This was what I began doing to insert each row into the table I had created earlier for my database. 
It took the whole weekend, but I was finally able to input the whole 345 rows for the first table which was the ‘science_org.’ I then went into the second table which was the statement table. This part was much tougher than the science_org table because it had more columns and the formatting was bad. I tried to use the copy code which can automatically import into the database, and as a result I encountered so many errors. Some of these were “long characters” this error happened because when creating the database and creating a column for the text in the statements table, the varchar I chose was 255. I chose this varchar because I looked online for what an average varchar would be for text in a database. In addition, it seemed reasonable. However, as I started inputting the data one after the other in the database, I realized that the varchar for the text was too small. I tried to edit the ‘text’ column but unfortunately could not as there was already data in the database. As a result, I then had to DROP TABLE (delete the ‘statement’ table) and started all over again. This was exhausting as I had already gone down the spreadsheet.
